📌 Problem Statement
Problem Statement 9 – Build the Ultimate Digital Habit Builder

🎯 Objective
This project is a simple, single-file HTML website that functions as a gamified habit tracker. It aims to make habit building more engaging and motivating through visual feedback, tracking metrics, and potential reward elements. Built for a hackathon, it demonstrates core front-end development skills using standard web technologies.

✨ Key Features
Highlight the most important features of your project:

1.  **Add a Habit:** Enter the name of your habit in the input field. If implemented, select a category and set a daily goal (e.g., "1" for simple completion, "3" for completing something three times a day). Click "Add Habit".
2.  **Track Completion:** Click on the day buttons next to a habit to mark completion for that day.
    * For habits with a daily goal of 1, clicking toggles between complete (✓) and incomplete (day number).
    * For habits with a daily goal greater than 1, clicking increments the completion count for that day, up to the set goal. The visual representation of the button will update to show your progress.
3.  **View Progress:** See your current and all-time longest streaks, completion percentage for the last 7 days, and daily goal progress update automatically.
4.  **Personalize:** Use the color picker to change the background color of the application.
5.  **Delete a Habit:** Click the trash can icon next to a habit and confirm the deletion in the browser's pop-up dialog.

🧪 How to Run the Project
Core Technologies:

Core Web Technologies & UI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
Build Tool (Vite)
Styling Framework (Tailwind CSS)
Key Project Dependencies (React, Charting, Icons)
Development Tools & Dependencies (Linters, TypeScript, Build Tools)
Local Setup:

Build the Application:

Run the command npm run build to create an optimized production build of your application. This will generate the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the dist directory.
Serve the dist Directory:

You can use a simple static file server to serve the contents of the dist directory. One common option is serve:


npm install -g serve
serve dist
This will start a server that serves the files in the dist directory. By default, it will run on port 3000. You can specify a different port using the -p option:


serve -p 8080 dist
Alternatively, you can use other static file servers like http-server or configure a web server like Nginx or Apache to serve the files.

Access the Application:

Once the server is running, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to the appropriate URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000 or the URL of your deployed server).
🧬 Future Scope
This project was developed as part of a hackathon. While contributions are not actively being sought post-hackathon, feel free to fork the repository and experiment!
